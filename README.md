# Ethics
After talking with a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, here are some points of concern:
- AI output should not end up in essay
	- Even the structure should *not* be AI-generated (patch-writing)
	- A sort of "mad-libs" style *may* be acceptable
		- Would be borderline and might be controversial
		- Not all professors would be so lenient
- May harm writers in the long run
	- May become a **crutch** for writers
	- Could remove the necessity for critical thinking
	- Users may not develop fundamental writing skills
